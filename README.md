# Python azure-mgmt-billing
A jupyter notebook exploring the Azure Python SDK package [azure-mgmt-billing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/overview/azure/billing/management?view=azure-python). 

This notebook explores the two available resources, invoices and periods. The azure-mgmt-billing package does not expose a method to get usage information, and the invoice resource only returns PDFs of invoices.
